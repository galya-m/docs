# Nevermined CLI

The Nevermined CLI (aka NVM CLI or `ncli`) enables interaction with the Nevermined deployment command line interface. It supports everything from the traditional Nevermined web environment like a Marketplace to a DApp.

The `ncli` allows developers to connect to a local Nevermined environment (see in the [Nevermined Tools tutorial](https://docs.nevermined.io/docs/tutorials/running-locally) how to do that) or with a remote one.

The `ncli` is Open Source software and the code can be found here [Nevermined CLI Github repository](https://github.com/nevermined-io/cli/).

In the following sections you will find more information about how to install and use the `ncli`:


import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
