# What is Nevermined?

Nevermined is a platform that provides reliable Web3 infrastructure that contains the building blocks, tools, and APIs for developers, projects, and protocols to register, discover, share, and interact with assets that can be easily and readily accessible in the Web3 environment.

The importance of Web3 ecosystems, digital assets, and consensus mechanisms cannot be overstated. Everything that is a part of Web3 relies on data sharing, multi-chain interactions, tokenization, visibility, interactivity and monetization of digital assets. Therefore, the growth and demand for reliable, secure, and efficient digital ecosystem infrastructure should continue to increase alongside Web3 development as a whole.

To this effect, Nevermined has a clear goal: to provide the ecosystem infrastructure necessary to make asset sharing and asset control easy and accessible. In  Web3 everything is an asset, creating the need for seamless, secure and reliable integration between systems, networks and protocols for data exchange, storage and access. Nevermined serves as an Asset Interactivity Engine / Protocol for Web3 that developers and enterprises can deploy to build, incubate and bring to market cross-chain Web3 products and extract the maximum value from their assets. Weâ€™re accomplishing this in a way that is in line with the principles of Web3 by working towards scaling infrastructure and promoting data sharing in a global, decentralized environment.
